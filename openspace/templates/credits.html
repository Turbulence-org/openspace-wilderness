            <p>The [ os ] wilderness was created during the Fall / Winter of 2013 / 2014 for the 2014 <a href="http://turbulence.org" target="_blank" class="mono dark">Turbulence Net Art Exhibition</a>.</p>
            <p>It is built with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" class="mono dark">django</a> 1.5 using python, jquery, html, and css. Every line of program code was written by me, builing upon the indispensable, <a href="https://github.com/rdegges/django-skel" target="_blank" class="mono dark">django-skel</a>. In addition to the primary site there is a mutant host of helper scripts and utility functions for retrieving, indexing, logging recovered blogs and processing images. This all is of little consequence to anyone but me who simply wishes to acknowledged some many hours.</p>
            <p>All of this was possible due to a feature of Blogger blogs created prior to 1999 wherein each blog was assigned a 9-digit incremental ID that can be used to query the blog through the google Blogger API and retrieve specified elements. After 1999 the blogs were created with a randomized 15-digit ID and are therefore not traversable in a straightforward manner. With a crawler script written to provide some light filtering and logging, I simply selected various insert points and let it go off collecting. I have, for-instance, deliberately chosen to filter non-english blogs (mostly), and blogs that contain less than 2 posts. You are only able to retrieve the 5 most recent posts querying a blog in this manner through the API, so many of the blogs contained in the wilderness have or may have had many many more posts. There are, however, thousands upon millions that have simply, "my first blog post!" and were subsequently forgotten.</p>
