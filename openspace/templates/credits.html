            <h3>[ openspace ] vernacular</h3>
            <p>The <strong>[openspace] wilderness</strong> was created during the Fall / Winter of 2013 / 2014 on a commission for <a href="http://turbulence.org" target="_blank" class="mono dark">[turbulence.org]</a>.</p>
            <p>It is built on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" class="mono dark">[django v1.5]</a> utilizing: python, jquery, html, and css. Every line of program code was written from scratch by me, building upon the indispensable, <a href="https://github.com/rdegges/django-skel" target="_blank" class="mono dark">[django-skel]</a>. In addition to the primary site there is a mutant host of helper scripts and utility functions for retrieving, indexing, and logging the recovered blogs and processing images.</p>
            <p>Assembling the whole collection was possible due to a feature of <strong>[Blogger]</strong> blogs created prior to 1999 wherein each blog was assigned a 9-digit incremental ID that can be used to query the blog via the google Blogger API and retrieve specified elements. After 1999 the blogs were created with a randomized 15-digit ID and are therefore not searchable in a straightforward manner. With a crawler script written to provide some light filtering and logging, I simply selected various insert points and let it go off collecting. I have, for-instance, deliberately chosen to filter non-english blogs (mostly), and blogs that contain less than 2 posts. You are only able to retrieve the 5 most recent posts querying a blog in this manner, so many of the blogs collected in the wilderness have or may have had many many more posts than are present here. There are, however, thousands upon millions that only have some version of: <em>"my first blog post!"</em> and were subsequently forgotten. Also of amusing note are the many many blogs which appear to spend their whole run apologizing for not updating - posts getting incrementally wider and wider apart until finally hitting some threshold and never logging-in again. This has been a fascinating project to build and I am sitting here, just prior to launch, wondering what will become of this wilderness once it is released into the wild. Funny that the contents of this site are currently as unknown to me as to anyone else.</p>
            <p>Always happy to answer any questions you may have. Cheers,<br/>
