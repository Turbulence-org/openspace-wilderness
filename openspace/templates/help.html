            <p>The <strong>[openspace] wilderness</strong> - a preserve of virtual space encompassing {{ mb_size }} MB of {{ abandoned_count }} abandoned social-network profiles as well a dynamic population of wildlife and visitors. The abandoned profiles which account for the bulk of the park?s area have been created by crawling long neglected blogs that have not received an update in 6 or more years. The names have been changed in order to protect the innocent, however the content of the abandoned profiles in the park is directly pulled from the posts recovered from the found blogs. Visitors to the park are welcome to view, <strong>[tag]</strong>, like: <strong>[+]</strong>, and <strong>[comment]</strong> the forgotten posts and profiles they encounter while wandering the site on: <strong>[@]</strong> or off: <strong>[&ndash;]</strong> <strong>[trails]</strong>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Visitors may opt to explore the park as either a <strong>[predator]</strong> or a <strong>[forager]</strong> which entreats them to certain attributes and actions - <strong>[predators]</strong> may <strong>[eat]</strong> prey they encounter whereas <strong>[foragers]</strong> may <strong>[graze]</strong> post content. As one of these active profiles, your <strong>[energy]</strong> will be depleted and you may eventually die of starvation if you don't consume a foodsource while you explore the park. As profiles die off, the environment will become littered with the dead explorers, opportunists, and colonizers that have wandered in.</p>
