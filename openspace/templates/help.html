            <p>Welcome Visitor to the open space wilderness. This site is a virtual nature preserve for a small section of the abandoned internet. This video is simply a quick primer to navigating the wilderness so that you may be well prepared to explore the site happily and safely on your own.</p>
            <p>To start, no one is required to create an account on the open space wilderness. Upon entry each guest is let in as an Anonymous Visitor. As a visitor most of the functionality of the site is already available to you. Your session display is here on the top left. You may view your session's profile at any time by simply clicking your icon. Underneath your profile is your session activity. This is simply a small feed of your most recent posts and actions. Let's start roaming through the park. On the top right are your navigation options. You may simply go forward, next. back, previous, or jump to a random profile. Profiles comprise the explorable space of the site. Each profile has a host of attributes and there are a number of ways that you may interact with each profiles such as. liking them. making friends. or commenting. Notice the message box at the top that flashed you notifications as you do things. In addition to these you may also tag a profile or post. Tagging objects in the wilderness creates trails which allow you and other visitors to navigate along paths of like profiles and posts. Note that if you tag a post, its profile also inherits the tag. Hopping on and off trails is simple, and the trails page displays a list of all the available trails and profiles along each trail. There are many ways to explore the park: navigate among friends, hop on and off trails, or using the navigation keys at the top. You may also use the search button at the top to discover posts containing words or phrases of your choosing.</p>
            <p>That about sums up the basic usage of the park, Now let's take a look at the other aspect of the openspace wilderness: its dynamic population. You will notice under your session icon a tab that says select species, clicking this will drop-down the two available active species options, predator or forager. Both active species can engage in any of the activities a visitor can, however they each have special actions that may be used while exploring the park. Let's create a predator. Clicking the tab creates a new predator profile for your session. It should look very familiar, however you will notice that there is now a large number that says energy on your session display. This is the life force of the active profile. As you navigate the park now, your energy will be depleted. Each active species must consume a food source as they move about or they will eventually die of starvation. Predators consume other active profiles for sustenance. As you navigate you may happen upon some prey. You will notice a red, eat button pops up on a consumable profile. Let's try it out. As you can see you have eaten this profile and gained its energy. Active profiles are invisible to regular visitors, but this dead prey will now be left to rot out in the open and other guests may happen upon it as they explore.</p>
            <p>Now let's look at the forager species. The foragers must consume a different foodsource to stay alive in the wilderness. Foragers graze on the content of posts. You will see the green graze button on profiles and posts that you are able to graze. You get less nutrients the more foragers there are currently in the site. As you graze you eat, the actual content of the bites you take get posted on the wall of your profile. Grazing is an irreversible process that affects the whole system. Will you go a little hungry and preserve the park for others? Your actions have consequences that affect the content and structure of the park. There is one more special thing worth mentioning. The protected tag will protect a post from being grazed by a forager. Use it sparingly to mark some of the truly unique discoveries you make as you explore.</p>
            <p>There are a number of other things to discover but most of all, the sheer unknown and undocumented breadth of the park itself. You should be well prepared to go exploring on your own now. Have fun, be safe, and ask the ranger if you have any questions. Welcome to the open space wilderness.</p>
