            <h3>[ openspace ] tutorial</h3>
            <p>Welcome, Visitor, to the <strong>[openspace] wilderness</strong>. This site is a virtual nature preserve for a small section of the abandoned internet. This is a quick primer to navigating the wilderness so that you may be well prepared to explore the site happily and safely on your own.</p>
            <p>To start, no one is required to create an account in the <strong>[ openspace ] wilderness</strong>. Upon entry each guest is admitted as an <strong>[Anonymous Visitor]</strong>. As a visitor most of the functionality of the site is already available to you. Your will notice your <strong>[session display]</strong> on the top left of the page. You may view your session's <strong>[profile]</strong> at any time by simply clicking your icon. Underneath your profile is your <strong>[session activity]</strong>. This is simply a small feed of your most recent posts and actions. On the top right are your <strong>[navigation options]</strong>. You may simply move forward - <strong>[next]</strong>, back - <strong>[previous]</strong>, or jump to a <strong>[random]</strong> profile. Profiles comprise the explorable space of the site. Each profile has a host of attributes and there are a number of ways that you may interact with each profiles such as: liking them - <strong>[+]</strong>, making friends - <strong>[f]</strong>, or <strong>[commenting]</strong>. In addition to these you may also <strong>[tag]</strong> a profile or post. Tagging objects in the wilderness creates <strong><a href="{% url 'tags:tags' %}">[trails]</a></strong> which allow you and other visitors to navigate along paths of like profiles and posts. Note that if you tag a post, its profile will also inherit the tag. Hopping on - <strong>[@]</strong> and off - <strong>[&ndash;]</strong> trails is simple, and the trails page displays a list of all the available trails and the profiles along each one. You may also use the <strong>[search]</strong> button at the top to discover posts containing words or phrases of your choosing.</p>
            <p>Another aspect to the <strong>[openspace] wilderness</strong> is its dynamic population. You will notice under your session icon a tab that says <strong>[select species]</strong>. Clicking this will drop-down the two available active species options: <strong>[predator]</strong> and <strong>[forager]</strong>. Both of these active species can engage in any of the activities a visitor can, however they each posses special actions that may be used while exploring the park. If you choose to create one of the active profiles you will be taken to the page of your new session profile. You session display will look similar, however you will now notice a large number that says <strong>[energy]</strong> - this is your active profile's life-force. Now as you navigate the park your energy will be depleted. Each active species must consume a foodsource as they move about or they will eventually <strong>[die of starvation]</strong>. <strong>[Predators]</strong> consume other active profiles for sustenance and <strong>[foragers]</strong> graze the content of posts. If you select a predator, you may eventually happen upon some <strong>[prey]</strong>. You will notice a red <strong>[eat]</strong> button pops up on a consumable profile. Active profiles are generally invisible to regular visitors, but eaten prey will now be left to rot out in the open, and other guests may happen upon it as they explore.</p>
            <p>If you select a <strong>[forager]</strong> you will see a green <strong>[graze]</strong> button on profiles and posts that you are able to consume. You will receive less nutrients the more foragers there are currently living in the site. By grazing you remove the actual content of posts and the bites you take will be re-posted on the wall of your profile. Grazing is an irreversible process that affects the whole system. Your actions have consequences that impact the content and structure of the park.</p>
            <p>To this effect, there is a <strong>[protected]</strong> tag available that will prevent a post being grazed by a forager. Use it sparingly to mark some of the truly unique discoveries you make as you wander.</p>
            <p>There are a number of other things to discover, but, most of all, you should enjoy exploring the sheer unknown and undocumented breadth of the park itself. You should be well prepared to go exploring on your own now. Have fun, be safe, and ask the <strong>[Ranger]</strong> if you have any questions. Thank you for visitng the <strong>[openspace] wilderness</strong>.</p>
