            <h3>[ openspace ] specifications</h3>
            <p>The openspace wilderness is a virtual wilderness enclosure for an abandoned social network. The grounds of the park cover over 5,000 profiles which were culled from Blogger Blogs that have not been updated in 10+ years</p>
            <p>There are foragers and predators that roam the park. The population of these re-colonizers is in constant flux. When the population of foragers grows too high, the park may be over-grazed and many of the virtual resources preserved within may be lost. The park requres a healthy population of predators to keep the foragers in check and preserve the wilderness.</p>
            <p>The openspace wilderness is a virtual archaeological site - a section of 10+ year old internet has been staked off for exploration and investigation. The visitors and population of the wilderness can tag, flag, and unearth the many possible treasures contained within the parks bounds</p>
