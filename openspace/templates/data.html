            <h3>[ openspace ] abstract</h3>
            <p>The boom and bust cycle of global capital creates many orphans and islands. A concrete Detroit or Pripyat - when the industry folds, the wells run dry, the air becomes poison, or the focus simply shifts, is left to sit empty and forlorn as a young and haunted human wilderness.</p>
            <p>This same boom and bust cycle is active in the virtual communities of the world - the tone shifts, the shark is jumped, the industry folds, and the people move on. What sorts of shells are left behind on an abandoned internet? Unnumbered and innumerable sites, blogs, profiles, comments, and media - remote, forgotten, and estranged from their architects sit silent and random. Since 2000 the number of internet users has grown over 7 times (from 361 million to 2,749 million). This rabid rate of  expansion necessarily leaves many ghost-towns in its drag. Whereas the empty places of the concrete world may be re-wilded and re-purposed, what utility or ability is there for scavengers, pickers, foragers, and opportunists to re-colonize and re-inhabit the abandoned sites of the virtual wild?</p>
